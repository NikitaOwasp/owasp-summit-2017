## Adrian Winckles

I’ve approached my employer who can give me the time to attend but isn’t going to be able to cover the accomodation cost but will cover travel. 

This is due to funding for me to go to AppSec Europe 2017 in Belfast in May with a team for the University Challenge

What I would also like to propose is two ideas for Workshops/Themes

 - [Software-Defined-Everything-(SDx)](../Workshops/Software-Defined-Everything-(SDx).html)
 - [Application Security BSc/Masters Curriculum Design)](../Workshops/AppSec-BSc-Masters-Curriculum-Design.html)
 

#### OWASP Contributions

* [OWASP Cambridge Chapter Leader](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cambridge)
* OWASP European Board Member
* [OWASP AppSec Europe 2014 Chair](https://2014.appsec.eu)
