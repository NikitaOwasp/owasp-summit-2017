## Avi Douglen

I am looking forward to joining the Threat Modeling workshop, as I have a lot of varied experience in this area, including constrained environments and limited engagements, as well as a full-scope in-depth ongoing security team. This is also my current area of focus.   

I am also happy to work on the Cheatsheets (these have already made some of my high-school students cry :-) ), as well as AppSec tools or GitHub workshops. Definitely also willing to help with the summit organization!
